          "Babysitting takes a turn for the worst\nCould you make it as a babysitter? What if the baby isnâ€™t actually a baby? The Baby in Yellow is a free horror game wherein you play as the babysitter. Everything appears normal; youâ€™ve fed the baby and changed his nappy. You watch television to pass the timeâ€”only to discover that the baby has made it to his parentsâ€™ bedroom. He cries incessantly but nothing seems to soothe him, so it looks like you're in for a long night"

          "https://cimoandroid.com/hraguaabdel/thebabyinyellow/thebabyinyellow.png",
          "The game begins with you inside the home. Other than you and the baby, there is no one else in there. Itâ€™s a plain yet modern houseâ€”there are no photos, notes, or items that will give you clues as to who the babyâ€™s parents are. All thatâ€™s left to do is tend to the baby. You will find the gameâ€™s chapter and instructions on the left side of your screen"

          "https://cimoandroid.com/hraguaabdel/thebabyinyellow/thebabyinyellow.png",
          "Instructions  are broken down step-by-step. For example, your first task is to feed the baby. Underneath this are bullet points on where to get the bottle and how to give the milk to the baby. The only note missing from the list of steps is that you can only carry one item at a time. This means you will need to sit the baby down in his chair before giving the milk"

          "https://cimoandroid.com/hraguaabdel/thebabyinyellow/thebabyinyellow.png",
          "Dropping the baby will not cause a commotion, but the lack of feeding will. As the game progresses, tasks will continuously be updated. Other than soothing the baby, the game does not have points or rewards. This allows you to test the gameâ€™s limits; you can keep dismissing the baby until he reveals his true self. For example, you can use the ragdoll physics of the game to stuff the baby in unusual places"
